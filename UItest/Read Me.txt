executable is in "UItest\Main\bin\x64\Release"
the program will ask for .clp files (you can select multiple files at one shot)
then ask for the folder that you store pictures
***********************************************
Rules for pictures!!
take coffee_bean_facts.clp for example.
(defrule acid_high
	?n<-(answer_of "What is the acid intensity?" acid2 )
	?p <- (nextQuestion(question "What is the acid intensity?" ))
             ?k <- (profile(name user))
  	=>
	(modify ?p(question "What is your favorite flavor?")(options Fruity Nutty Sweetness Special))
	(modify ?k(acidity 2))
	(retract ?n)
)

you can see if the criterias fits(means previous question has been answered.)
the rule should retract the answer for last question,then modify the fact "nextQuestion" fill it with question and options

!!!!!!!IMPORTANT!!!!!!!
the picture name should be the same as you put in the options.
for above example, options are Fruity Nutty Sweetness Special,so there shoud have 
pictures named Fruit.jpg Nutty.jpg Sweetness.jpg Special.jpg in the folder 
and another set of pictures CFruit.jpg CNutty.jpg CSweetness.jpg CSpecial.jpg for blur version of that option.

To end the program:
last rule should be something like this

(defrule bean_recommand 
	?p <- (nextQuestion(question "findBeansNow"))
  	=>
	(modify ?p(question "finished"))
)

When C# find the next question string is "finished"
it will end the loop and show all options for the last question.
(so you shoud pass question string "finished" and recommanded result as option for showing)
